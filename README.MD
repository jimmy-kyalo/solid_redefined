#SOLID PRINCIPLE

    Single responsibility

Each class should have only one sole purpose,
and not be filled with excessive responsibility.

    Open Closed

Classes should be opened for extension,
closed for modification.

    Liskov substitution

Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable
for their parent or base class.

    Interface segregation

Interfaces should not force classes to implement what
they cannot do.
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

    Dependency inversion

Components should depend on abstractions, not concretions.
